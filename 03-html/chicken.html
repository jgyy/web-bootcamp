        <p>
          The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
          junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from
          Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird,
          and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
          castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen and a
          sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
          were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
          <abbr title="Before the Common Era">BCE</abbr>).<sup>[1][2]</sup>
          Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
          their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and
          an adult female is called a hen.
        </p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          According to <span>Merriam-Webster</span>, the term
          &quot;rooster&quot; (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or
          late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of
          the original English "cock", and is widely used throughout North
          America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night,
          which is done by both sexes.
        </p>

          <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
          <p>
            Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil
            to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards,
            small snakes, or young mice.
          </p>

            <figcaption>
              In most breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen
              by his larger comb.

          </figure>
          <p>
            The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the
            breed.[28] The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of
            heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World
            Records.[29]

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>
          Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
          communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
          Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
          "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food
          access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
          causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking
          order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
          existing flock can lead to fighting and injury. When a rooster finds
          food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by
          clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
          This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
          chicks and encourage them to eat.
