    <h1>Chicken as food</h1>
    <p><a href="chicken.html">Chicken</a> is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease
        and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent in
        numerous cuisines.</p>
    <p>Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling.
        Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is
        sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated
        fat.</p>
    <p>The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different
        parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while
        less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates
        there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.</p>
