    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish or cuttles<sup>[2]</sup> are <a href="#marine">marine</a> molluscs of the order
      Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid,
      octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
      cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.
      represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene. Whether
      the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
      Octopodiformes, remains unclear.<sup>[9]</sup>

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
      temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
      they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).<sup>[10]</sup>
      They have an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the
      coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as
      well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from
      the Americas. By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World,
      the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these
      warm-water species to cross.<sup>[11]</sup> The common cuttlefish (Sepia
      officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas,
      although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
      found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the
      continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).<sup>[12]</sup> The cuttlefish
      is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red
      List of Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation
      of the marine animal has occurred in some regions due to large-scale
      commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being
      too threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher
      levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a
      potential threat.<sup>[13]</sup>

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
      organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally
      differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.<sup>[14]</sup>
      Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are
      thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a
      smoothly curving W-shape.<sup>[15][16]</sup> Although cuttlefish cannot
      see color,<sup>[17]</sup> they can perceive the polarization of light,
      which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of
      concentrated sensor cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look
      more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by
      shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina,
      instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no
      blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the
      retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern
      depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both
      eyes.<sup>[18][19]</sup>
